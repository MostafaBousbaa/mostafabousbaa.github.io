I’m **Mostafa Bousbaa**, a *Ph.D. researcher* at the [Center for Remote Sensing Applications (CRSA)](https://crsa.um6p.ma/home), part of the **College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences** at [Mohammed VI Polytechnic University (UM6P)](http://um6p.ma/fr) in Ben Guerir, Morocco.

My research focuses on **multi-sensor image fusion** for *snow hydrology applications* in the Moroccan context. I aim to enhance water resource management by integrating **multi-source satellite data**, **hydrological modeling techniques**, and **artificial intelligence** approaches such as machine learning and deep learning. This work spans from experimental field studies to large-scale basin-level analysis.

My thesis is supervised by [Prof. Abdelghani Boudhar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3P8GYSYAAAAJ&hl=fr), as part of the *MorSnow Project* — *Monitoring and Quantifying Snowmelt Contribution for Moroccan Water Management Strategies in the Context of Climate Change*.

In addition, I coordinate the **DigitalHub Network Community**, a platform dedicated to building digital skills and empowering youth and professionals across Morocco and Africa.
