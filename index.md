I’m **Mostafa Bousbaa**, a *Ph.D. researcher* at the [Center for Remote Sensing Applications (CRSA)](https://crsa.um6p.ma/home), part of the **College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences** at [Mohammed VI Polytechnic University (UM6P)](http://um6p.ma/fr) in Ben Guerir, Morocco.

I received my **B.Sc. in Geomatics and Territorial Management** (2019) and **M.Sc. in Environmental Geomatics** (2021) from the **Faculty of Science and Techniques (FST), Beni Mellal**, Morocco. Since **2022**, I have been pursuing my Ph.D. at **CRSA–UM6P**, where my work lies at the intersection of **remote sensing, hydrology, and geoinformatics**.

My research focuses on leveraging **multi-sensor image fusion** for *snow hydrology applications* in the Moroccan context. I aim to enhance **water resources management**—from experimental studies to large-scale basin analysis—by integrating **multi-source data**, **hydrological modeling**, and **artificial intelligence** approaches. My expertise spans **remote sensing**, **hydrology**, **GIS**, **machine learning**, and **deep learning**, with applications in **environmental monitoring** and **water resources management**.

My Ph.D. is supervised by [Prof. Abdelghani CHEHBOUNI](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/A-Chehbouni) and co-supervised by [Prof. Abdelghani Boudhar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3P8GYSYAAAAJ&hl=fr), within the *MorSnow Project* — *Monitoring and Quantifying Snowmelt Contribution for Moroccan Water Management Strategies in the Context of Climate Change*.

I also served as a **Visiting Researcher** at the **Institute of Methodologies for Environmental Analysis (IMAA)**, part of the **Department of Earth System Sciences and Technologies for the Environment** of the **National Research Council (CNR), Italy**, where I collaborated with [Dr. Gemine Vivone](https://sites.google.com/site/vivonegemine/) on **deep learning-based spatio-temporal fusion** methods for multi-sensor Earth observation data and **high-resolution product generation**.

In addition to my research, I coordinate the **DigitalHub Network Community**, a platform dedicated to building digital skills and empowering youth and professionals across Morocco and Africa.
